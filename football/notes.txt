What works
* standingsFunctions.py can get standings for any week, up to the current week. It can do just H2H
  or it can also account for the extra win/loss based on bottom/top half teams in a given week. It
  can also print the standings and the most points per week in a user-friendly format.
* standings_<league>.py for friends and Johnson's league prints the standings and extra WL. Useful
  for in-season calculation of these things without doing in by hand
* odds_<league>.py attempts to predict odds of making the playoffs. It doesn't quite work for
  Johnson's league yet because his playoff seeding is top 4 by record, then top 2 by most points
  remaining.  

Big features to add
* Playoff odds simulator for each league. Create several options for how to simulate matchup
  outcomes. Two basic ones are "draw scores from a distribution" and "coin flip", i.e. coin flip
  assumes that everything is completely luck-based. You should standardize the score outcomes
  functions. It would be really cool if this could somehow be based on going-forward projections of
  individual player performance based on current roster construciton; otherwise, just make a few
  functions that simulate a score so that you can implement the options repeatably for each league.
  For example:
  --> Score drawn from normal distribution with mean and stdev
  --> Score drawn from lognomral distribution with mean and stdev

Fun features to add:
* Historical performance in a table or graph form, per league. Some ideas:
  --> Most H2H wins all time (regular season and/or playoffs)
  --> Total fantasy points all time (regular season and/or playoffs)
  --> Total wins/losses against each opponent, e.g. who have you dominated, who is your rival
  --> In-season "luck" calculator. How do you define bad luck? It could be
      --> Scoring less points than expected
      --> Losing H2H despite high point total for the week
      --> Low in standings despite high total fantasy points
      --> How could you quantify these factors into a number and rank luckiness?
* Measure roster start/sit skill, see https://stmorse.github.io/journal/fantasy-bench.html

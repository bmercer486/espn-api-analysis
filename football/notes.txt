What works
* standingsFunctions.py can get standings for any week, up to the current week. It can do just H2H
  or it can also account for the extra win/loss based on bottom/top half teams in a given week. It
  can also print the standings and the most points per week in a user-friendly format.
* standings_<league>.py for friends and Johnson's league prints the standings and extra WL. Useful
  for in-season calculation of these things without doing in by hand
* odds_<league>.py attempts to predict odds of making the playoffs. It doesn't quite work for
  Johnson's league yet because his playoff seeding is top 4 by record, then top 2 by most points
  remaining.  

Big features to add
* Playoff odds simulator for each league. Create several options for how to simulate matchup
  outcomes. Two basic ones are "draw scores from a distribution" and "coin flip", i.e. coin flip
  assumes that everything is completely luck-based. You should standardize the score outcomes
  functions. It would be really cool if this could somehow be based on going-forward projections of
  individual player performance based on current roster construciton; otherwise, just make a few
  functions that simulate a score so that you can implement the options repeatably for each league.
  For example:
  --> Score drawn from normal distribution with mean and stdev
  --> Score drawn from lognomral distribution with mean and stdev

Fun features to add:
* Historical performance in a table or graph form, per league. Some ideas:
  --> Most H2H wins all time (regular season and/or playoffs)
  --> Total fantasy points all time (regular season and/or playoffs)
  --> Total wins/losses against each opponent, e.g. who have you dominated, who is your rival
  --> In-season "luck" calculator. How do you define bad luck? It could be
      --> Scoring less points than expected
      --> Losing H2H despite high point total for the week
      --> Low in standings despite high total fantasy points
      --> How could you quantify these factors into a number and rank luckiness?
* Measure roster start/sit skill, see https://stmorse.github.io/journal/fantasy-bench.html

Fixed Johnson's league odds calculator to correctly handle the wildcard stuff.

A good update: can you use or modify the standings calculator function to figure out the standings
per simulation? This would be much cleaner than what you currently have. Basically the idea would
be:
* Simulate a bunch of scores for the remainder of the regular season
* Input the weekly scores and team schedules into the standings function and have it spit out end-of
  season standings (which do not do any wildcard calculation)
  --> So then you modify the standings for Johnson's league
* You may need a new or modified standings calculation function to do this but it would be a good
  idea

Historical project: Start with something easy, say, most fantasy points all-time
--> Hard part: loop on years and accumulate owners
--> Once you have owners, loop on owners and add up regular season fantasy point totals
--> Think about how to plot
